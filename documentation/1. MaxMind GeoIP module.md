# MaxMind GeoIP for Dashboard

[MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home) provide a database that converts IP addresses to countries or other information.  This module for [Dashboard](https://github.com/userdashboard/dashboard) adds API routes for identifying the country by IP and a server handler that will binds a Country object to each HttpRequest.

There is much more data in the MaxMind database, pull requests are welcome to add more API routes to access it.
